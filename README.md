# Client-and-Server-Programs--Java-
The purpose of these programs was to create a Server and Client class that will have a conversation with each other. The Client 
waits for the Server to start the conversation and then it is sent from the Server to the Client. Then the Client sends a message 
to the Server and this occurs back and forth until the Client says "bye" to the Server.
